# Data-Visuallization_HR_analysis

## Project description
I’m the head of the HR department and I want to know what makes the employees stay or leave the company. I have collected some information from employees and you can find the data and description https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/hr-employee-data-descriptive-analytics. I would like you to explore this data however you want and return me a 5 to 10-minute reading report to target my question.

Audience: I’m a HR manager that doesn’t know anything about coding. I’m familiar with the information collected but haven’t seen or done any EDA or visualization for it yet (i.e. I don’t know any summary statistics or any insights from the data)
